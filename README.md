I built this weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show real-time weather information for any location. The app connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to get accurate weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also shows the weather for your current location if you allow it.

Key Features:

**. Real-time weather updates.**

**. Displays current location and weather data.**

**. Wind speed information along with temperature and humidity.**

**. Simple and responsive user interface.**

**. Reliable data from a trusted source (OpenWeatherMap API).**
